    "```\n",
    "Category 1. Raw data --- --- --- ---> Visualization ---> Analysis\n",
    "Category 2. Raw data ---> Mining ---> Visualization ---> Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Category 1\n",
    "   Map 1 - NYC pedastrain intensity and toilets distribution map\n",
    "   Map 2 - NYC public toilet service coverage map\n",
    "   Solar bar chart - NYC public toilets opening hours clock\n",
    "\n",
    "Category 2\n",
    "   Heat matrix - Affinity heat matrix between NYC public toilets and other domain categories\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `Category 1`, in our project, all of its figures are for **reader-driven** which means the main task for us here is to complete the visualization of the Raw data, plot them nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, here, I will focus on explaining the `Mining` part we did in `Category 2` with the heat matrix, which better fits my understanding of data analysis that should be included in the current Jupyter document (just like the Machine learning mentioned in the project requirement, which is a part of `Mining`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For the heap matrix presented in the website\n",
    "\n",
    "During the mining prosess, I explored the spatial distribution similarity between public restrooms and various Points of Interest (POI) in New York City. The focus was on determining which types of urban facilities share similar geographic distribution patterns with public restrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis relied on two key data attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Geographic coordinates**: Latitude and longitude of each facility\n",
    "2. **Category labels**: Facility type classifications including:\n",
    "   - Public Restrooms\n",
    "   - Educational Facilities\n",
    "   - Cultural Facilities\n",
    "   - Recreational Facilities\n",
    "   - Social Services\n",
    "   - Transportation Facilities\n",
    "   - ......\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization Options\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the distribution affinity, several visualization approaches were considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial density maps**: Direct visualization of each facility type's distribution\n",
    "2. **MDS plots**: 2D projection preserving distance relationships between facility types\n",
    "3. **t-SNE plots**: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction emphasizing local clustering patterns\n",
    "4. **Similarity heat matrix**: Direct visualization of similarity values between all facility pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity heat matrix was selected as the most user-friendly and intuitive visualization method because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directly shows similarity values between all facility types\n",
    "- Allows quick identification of facilities most similar to public restrooms\n",
    "- Provides exact numerical similarity values via tooltips\n",
    "- Presents a clean, easily interpretable format for non-technical audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat matrix visualization represents spatial distribution similarity between facility types in NYC, focusing specifically on these key methodological components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Density Grid Analysis\n",
    "- Created uniform grid cells (0.01° × 0.01°) across NYC\n",
    "- Generated 2D histograms of facility occurrences within each grid cell\n",
    "- Normalized density distributions by total facility count per type\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cosine Similarity Metric\n",
    "The core mathematical method behind the heat matrix is the cosine similarity measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{similarity}(A,B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\cdot ||B||} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- A and B are spatial density vectors for different facility types\n",
    "- Each vector component represents normalized facility density in a specific grid cell\n",
    "- The measure quantifies similarity in spatial distribution patterns regardless of absolute facility counts\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables comparison of spatial patterns rather than raw facility numbers, identifying meaningful relationships between different urban facility distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat matrix visualization was implemented using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy's histogram2d**: For computing spatial density grids\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn's cosine_similarity**: For calculating similarity between facility type distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The reletad part of my code is presented in the following code cell."

    "- Achieved high-quality spatial and temporal visualizations that meet our aesthetic standards\n",

    "- Established technical foundation integrating Python and JavaScript when doing visualization\n",
    "- The team collaboration goes really smooth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Technical Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Integration & Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Current visualizations exist as separate entities rather than a cohesive dashboard. We need a true partitioned poster approach with linked visualizations, like time-filtered coverage radius. Dashboard implementation faced challenges with Python libraries (Plotly Dash) due to customization limitations. More extensive HTML/JS/CSS integration would enhance flexibility but was constrained by project timeline. We are now considering responsive design.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visualization Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python-based web visualization offers streamlined workflow but lacks customization flexibility. A hybrid approach was required, embedding JavaScript within Python, to achieve desired interactions. Web presentation context demands higher attention to visual and interactive experience than scientific visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Non-Technical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we created a user-driven presentation for this project. Cuz we stuck at the very beginning for a while, maybe with more time, we could do more analysis and exploration from specific angles, balancing user-driven and author-guided approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our's feeling, the current work could be like the first step of a larger project, possibly related to digital twins, social sciences or similar fields. During team discussions, we felt excited about the future possibilities of this project."
