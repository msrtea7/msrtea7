### **Home Bar Operation | Denmark**

*2024 to present*

During my overseas studies, I've been "operating" a home bar, hosting students from different regions and cultural backgrounds around the world.

In this context, my language and communication skills have improved, and I've also recognized the value of bars in the service industry.

During this time, I've also been exploring overseas bars and distilleries.

<br/>

### **Added Value**

I'm very eager to "apply what I've learned" by combining my passion for alcohol with computer science, which is why I want to gain experience in the bar industry. I have ideas such as:

- Designing and developing efficient beverage inventory management systems
- Developing a knowledge base for store drink menus and recipes to facilitate team learning and training
- Data analysis and visualization of cocktail books

However, without industry experience, I cannot verify whether these ideas are valuable. If you have any similar ideas, I would be very happy to communicate and exchange thoughts with everyone.

## **My Limitations**

Due to academic reasons, I plan to work for about **2 months** from July to August. I'm well aware of the limitations this brings, but I don't want to hide it.

Although my working time is limited, I hope to maximize my abilities and value as much as possible.

If your team needs temporary help and someone who can quickly adapt to the job, I hope you will consider me.

I'm very much looking forward to progressing with your team!
